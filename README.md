# G89.2023.T02.EG4

The files after applying refactoring are all in SRC.

The docs directory has our report where the summaries and commentaries on the papers are.
Inside of it is the test_results folder where there are images of the running of the python tests(mostly the original tests, but we modified one(commented))
There are also pictures of running pybuilder, pylint and the pictures of the result of running pybuilder (photo of the reports and coverage).
